# Device Profiles and Energy Consumption

## Device Categories

OikosNomos tracks energy consumption across several device categories. Each category represents a group of similar devices or systems in your home.

---

## 1. Base Load

**Average Daily Consumption**: 3.5 kWh  
**Standby Power**: 150 W  
**Typical Monthly Cost**: $30-35

### What's Included
- Refrigerator/freezer
- Wi-Fi router and modem
- Cable/satellite boxes
- Digital clocks
- Doorbell transformers
- Garage door openers (standby)
- Security system

### Characteristics
- **Always-on**: Runs 24/7
- **Essential**: Cannot be eliminated
- **Optimization**: Replace old fridge, unplug unused devices

### Cost Impact
Base load is unavoidable but represents the "floor" of your energy usage. A typical home's base load accounts for 15-25% of total consumption.

## 2. Office Equipment

**Average Daily Consumption**: 2.1 kWh  
**Standby Power**: 8 W  
**Typical Monthly Cost**: $18-22

### What's Included
- Desktop computers
- Monitors (1-3)
- Printers/scanners
- External hard drives
- Desk lamps
- Phone chargers

### Characteristics
- **Usage Pattern**: Weekday mornings/evenings
- **Standby Waste**: 10-15% of consumption when devices are "off"
- **Smart Optimization**: Auto-sleep, power strips

### Cost Impact
Office devices are moderate consumers but have high standby waste. Using smart power strips can save 10-15% on this category.

## 3. HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning)

**Average Daily Consumption**: 18 kWh  
**Standby Power**: 50 W  
**Typical Monthly Cost**: $150-180

### What's Included
- Central air conditioning
- Furnace/heat pump
- Attic fans
- Whole-house fans
- Humidifier/dehumidifier

### Characteristics
- **Seasonal**: High in summer/winter, low in spring/fall
- **Highly Variable**: Depends on outdoor temperature
- **Largest Consumer**: Often 40-60% of total bill

### Cost Impact
HVAC is the single largest energy consumer in most homes. Small temperature adjustments (2-3°F) can save 10-15% on this category. Time-of-use optimization (pre-cooling before peak hours) can save an additional 15-20%.

**Comfort Trade-off**: Moderate. Most people adapt to 74°F instead of 72°F.

## 4. Garden Pump / Irrigation

**Average Daily Consumption**: 1.2 kWh  
**Standby Power**: 0 W  
**Typical Monthly Cost**: $8-12

### What's Included
- Irrigation pump
- Sprinkler system controllers
- Drip irrigation systems
- Water features (ponds, fountains)

### Characteristics
- **Seasonal**: High in summer, minimal in winter
- **Schedulable**: Runs on timers
- **Optional**: Can be reduced or eliminated

### Cost Impact
Garden irrigation is a discretionary load. Reducing watering frequency or switching to drought-resistant landscaping can eliminate this category entirely.

**Comfort Trade-off**: Low to medium. Lawn may brown in summer without irrigation.

## 5. EV Charger

**Average Daily Consumption**: 25 kWh  
**Standby Power**: 5 W  
**Typical Monthly Cost**: $200-250

### What's Included
- Level 2 home EV charger (240V, 7-10 kW)
- Charging cable/connector

### Characteristics
- **High Consumption**: Equivalent to adding another home's worth of usage
- **Highly Optimizable**: Can shift 100% to off-peak hours
- **Predictable**: Charges on schedule

### Cost Impact
An EV adds significant consumption but is highly optimizable. Charging overnight during off-peak hours (11pm-6am) can save $50-80/month compared to peak charging.

**Example**:
- Peak charging (4pm-9pm): 25 kWh × $0.45/kWh = $11.25/day = $337/month
- Off-peak charging (11pm-6am): 25 kWh × $0.25/kWh = $6.25/day = $187/month
- **Savings**: $150/month

**Comfort Trade-off**: None if you don't need immediate charging.

## 6. Entertainment

**Average Daily Consumption**: 1.8 kWh  
**Standby Power**: 12 W  
**Typical Monthly Cost**: $15-20

### What's Included
- TVs (1-3)
- Streaming devices (Roku, Apple TV, etc.)
- Game consoles
- Audio systems
- Smart speakers

### Characteristics
- **Peak Hours**: Evening (6pm-11pm)
- **Standby Waste**: 15-20% when "off"
- **Variable**: Depends on usage habits

### Cost Impact
Entertainment devices are moderate consumers with high standby waste. Modern TVs use 100-200W when on, but 5-15W when "off" (standby).

**Optimization**: Smart power strips, unplug when traveling.

---

## 7. Kitchen Appliances

**Average Daily Consumption**: 2.5 kWh  
**Standby Power**: 30 W  
**Typical Monthly Cost**: $22-28

### What's Included
- Microwave
- Dishwasher
- Coffee maker
- Toaster/toaster oven
- Instant Pot / slow cooker
- Range hood

### Characteristics
- **Peak Usage**: Morning and evening
- **High Power, Short Duration**: Microwave pulls 1200W but only for 2-3 minutes
- **Schedulable**: Dishwasher can run off-peak

### Cost Impact
Kitchen appliances have moderate impact. Running the dishwasher overnight (off-peak) saves $0.50-1.00 per load.

## Device Mix Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Minimal (2015 Baseline)
- Base Load + HVAC + Kitchen
- **Daily**: 24 kWh
- **Monthly**: 720 kWh
- **Estimated Cost**: $60-75/month

### Scenario 2: Hybrid (2020 Typical)
- All except EV
- **Daily**: 30 kWh
- **Monthly**: 900 kWh
- **Estimated Cost**: $90-110/month

### Scenario 3: Fully Smart (2024)
- All categories active
- **Daily**: 55 kWh
- **Monthly**: 1650 kWh
- **Estimated Cost**: $180-220/month

### Scenario 4: Optimized Smart
- All categories, but EV charged off-peak, HVAC pre-cooled
- **Daily**: 55 kWh
- **Monthly**: 1650 kWh
- **Estimated Cost**: $140-160/month (25% savings)

## How to Reduce Consumption

1. **Identify Highest Consumers**: HVAC, EV, Office
2. **Shift Schedulable Loads**: EV, dishwasher, laundry to off-peak
3. **Reduce Standby Power**: Smart plugs, power strips
4. **Optimize HVAC**: Programmable thermostat, 2-3°F adjustment
5. **Eliminate Optional Loads**: Garden pump in winter, unused office equipment

## CO₂ Emissions

All devices use grid electricity with an average **0.42 kg CO₂ per kWh**.

**Monthly CO₂ by Scenario**:
- Minimal: 302 kg
- Hybrid: 378 kg
- Fully Smart: 693 kg
- Optimized Smart: 693 kg (same consumption, cleaner times)

Shifting usage to off-peak hours reduces emissions because more renewable energy (solar/wind) is available during midday and overnight.
