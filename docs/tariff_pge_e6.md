# PG&E E-6 Time-of-Use Tariff

## Overview

The PG&E E-6 tariff is a residential time-of-use (TOU) rate schedule designed for customers with electric vehicles or who can shift their energy usage to off-peak hours.

## Rate Structure

### Fixed Charges
- **Monthly Service Charge**: $10.00

### Energy Charges (Tiered + Time-of-Use)

#### Tier 1 (0-400 kWh/month)

**Summer (June - September)**
- Off-Peak (11pm-3pm): $0.25/kWh
- Partial-Peak (3pm-4pm, 9pm-11pm): $0.30/kWh
- Peak (4pm-9pm): $0.45/kWh

**Winter (October - May)**
- Off-Peak (11pm-3pm): $0.23/kWh
- Partial-Peak (3pm-4pm, 9pm-11pm): $0.27/kWh
- Peak (4pm-9pm): $0.35/kWh

#### Tier 2 (Above 400 kWh/month)

**Summer**
- Off-Peak: $0.35/kWh
- Partial-Peak: $0.40/kWh
- Peak: $0.55/kWh

**Winter**
- Off-Peak: $0.33/kWh
- Partial-Peak: $0.37/kWh
- Peak: $0.45/kWh

## Time-of-Use Periods

### Peak Hours (Highest Cost)
- **When**: 4pm - 9pm every day
- **Why**: High grid demand when people come home from work
- **Strategy**: Avoid running high-power devices (dryer, EV charging, pool pump)

### Partial-Peak Hours (Medium Cost)
- **When**: 3pm-4pm and 9pm-11pm
- **Strategy**: Moderate usage acceptable, but still higher than off-peak

### Off-Peak Hours (Lowest Cost)
- **When**: 11pm - 3pm (overnight and midday)
- **Why**: Low grid demand
- **Strategy**: Best time for EV charging, laundry, dishwasher

## Cost Savings Strategies

1. **Shift EV Charging**: Charge overnight (11pm-6am) to save $0.20-$0.30/kWh
2. **Run Major Appliances Off-Peak**: Dishwasher, washing machine, dryer
3. **Pre-cool in Summer**: Run AC harder before 4pm, raise temp during peak
4. **Avoid Tier 2**: Keep monthly usage under 400 kWh if possible

## Example Monthly Bill

**Scenario**: 450 kWh/month usage, Summer
- Tier 1 (400 kWh): 200 kWh off-peak ($50) + 150 kWh partial ($45) + 50 kWh peak ($22.50) = $117.50
- Tier 2 (50 kWh): 30 kWh off-peak ($10.50) + 20 kWh peak ($11) = $21.50
- Service charge: $10.00
- **Total**: $149.00

**Optimized**: Shift 50 kWh from peak to off-peak
- Tier 1 (400 kWh): 250 kWh off-peak ($62.50) + 150 kWh partial ($45) + 0 kWh peak = $107.50
- Tier 2 (50 kWh): 50 kWh off-peak ($17.50)
- Service charge: $10.00
- **Total**: $135.00
- **Savings**: $14/month or $168/year

## CO₂ Emissions Factor

PG&E's grid mix has an average emissions factor of **0.42 kg CO₂ per kWh**.

Cleaner power sources are available during off-peak hours (more solar/wind), so shifting usage also reduces your carbon footprint.

## Eligibility

E-6 is best for households that:
- Own an electric vehicle
- Can shift major energy usage to off-peak hours
- Have programmable or smart appliances
- Are home during midday (solar generation peak)

## Enrollment

Contact PG&E or switch online. You can change rate plans once every 12 months.
